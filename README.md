<h1 align=center>What is Inverse?</a></h3>


____

<h3 align=center>Inverse is a simple, easy to use, lightweight, and open-source Discord bot. This was developed by Downrest#6466.</a></h3>

<h3 align=center>I'm planning to add more tools, and make it more simpler and cleaner. These planned additions are moderation tools, fun commands, and others. Feel free to use any of the code on this repository, it is open-source after all.</a></h3>

<h3 align=center>If you found this bot helpful, please star this repository!</a></h3>
